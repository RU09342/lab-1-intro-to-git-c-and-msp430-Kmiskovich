## Math Library 
This is simply a library for basic math functions.

## Dependencies
This code requires a header file to be referenced in the main.c file. The header was given "math.h" and must be referenced.

## Usage
Following the syntax given in the function definition, you must input the desired function as: math(n1, n2, op); where n1 and n2 are the values being operated upon and op is the operation (being add, subtract, etc.)

### Functions
For example, if you want to add 5 and 10, you would enter: math(5, 10, '+'); this would yield a value of 15.

### Known Errors
Currently, the program throws an error if you try to divide any value by 0. Other than that, it works fine for any integer.
